        <h3>Step by step instructions on how to make lasagna that tastes like home!</h3>
            <p> When I was growing up my grandma was always known for her delicious lasagna.  
                She would make it every Sunday when the family would come over for dinner.  
                My favorite times were all the nights that I was able to help her make dinner.</p>
            <p>When I was really little I needed to stand on a step stool to reach the counter while 
                my grandma and I were cooking.  I loved how tall that stool made me.  My grandma's recipes 
                have always brought me right back to feeling that way.  That's why I want to share them all with you.</p>

                <li>1 egg </li>

            <h4><u>Directions</u></h4>
                <h5>Making the sauce:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan.</li>
                    <li>In a large skillet or heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat up the olive oil and add the ground beef and pork.</li>
                    <li>Cook until all the meat is well browned, approximately 8 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Drain excess fat from the meat, reserving 2 tablespoons in the skillet, and remove the meat mixture from the pan. Cover and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add the onion to the skillet with the reserved fat and sauté until translucent, for about 6 to 7 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the mushrooms and garlic to the skillet and cook until the mushrooms are soft, or 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Return the meat to the pan and stir well.</li>
                    <li>Add the tomato sauce and dried herbs to the meat, garlic, and onions. Stir well.</li>
                    <li>Bring the meat sauce to a simmer and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the red sauce from heat and season to taste with kosher salt and black pepper.</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>Assembling the lasagna:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 F. In a 3-quart ovenproof baking dish, ladle enough of the red meat sauce to cover the bottom of the baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Arrange a layer of pasta atop the red meat sauce and then another layer of red sauce.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle roughly 1/3 of the white sauce evenly atop the red sauce. </li>
                    <li>Repeat the previous step twice by layering layers of pasta, red sauce, and white sauce.</li>
                    <li>Spread the shredded mozzarella on top of the final white sauce layer.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the grated Parmesan on top of the mozzarella.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake for 40 minutes.</li>
                    <li>After 40 minutes, remove foil and bake for about 10 more minutes, or until the cheese on top has browned slightly. Remove lasagna from oven and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
